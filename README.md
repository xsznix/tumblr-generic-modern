# Generic Modern Theme for Tumblr

This theme is a flat, minimalist theme for Tumblr that has a strong focus on content and a slight obsession with circular things.

## Usage

To use, paste the contents of `tumblr.html` into Tumblr's "Edit HTML" box under your blog customisation options. You should pass it through an HTML minifier to optimise page load times.

Remove the Google Analytics ID from the line `ga('create', 'UA-41144558-2', 'tumblr.com');` and put in your own if desired.
